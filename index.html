    <p>Today is a good day because it's not raining.  when it rains, it's a bad day.  when it's cloudy, it's a bad day.  when it's sunny, i love it- this is a great day for me.  I love eating ice cream on sunny days.  I also enjoy sleeping on rainy and cloudy days.  Hamburgers make my back hurt when I chew backwards with my tonsils.  But that's okay because I have gum.  Tomorrow will be nice because it will be sunny. FIN!</P>
